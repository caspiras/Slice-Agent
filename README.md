**A local-first IDE wrapper for Ollama models. Chat naturally. Edit code with diffs. Read/write documents. All permission-gated. All local.**

Slice is a beautiful terminal IDE that wraps local Ollama models with practical coding tools. Built with **Python** and the **Rich** library, it provides streaming chat, code editing with diffs, document operations, and git integration - all sandboxed to your project directory.

## 🆕 What's New in v1.5.1

- **🎯 Skills System** - Create custom slash commands with predefined instructions
  - Each skill is a folder inside `slice-skills/` containing a `skill.md` file
  - Folder name = invocation name (e.g., `slice-skills/deploy/skill.md` → `/deploy`)

- ✏️ **Code editing with diffs** - Propose changes, review side-by-side diffs, apply with approval
- 📄 **Universal document editing** - Read/write PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, CSV, Markdown, and ANY text-based file
- 🔧 **Bash execution** - Run commands after approval
- 🌳 **Git integration** - Stage, commit, create branches (never auto-pushes)
- 🔒 **Directory sandboxing** - All operations confined to current directory
- 🍕 **Beautiful terminal UI** - Streaming responses with Rich styling

## Prerequisites

Before installing Slice, you need:

1. **Python 3.9 or higher**
   ```bash
   python3 --version  # Should show 3.9+
   ```

2. **Ollama installed and running**
   - Download from [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai/)
   - Install for your OS (macOS, Linux, Windows)

3. **At least one Ollama model downloaded**
   ```bash
   # Recommended models for best results:
   ollama pull gemma4      # Best for mixed chat/actions
   ollama pull mistral     # Fast and reliable
   ollama pull qwen2       # Great multilingual support
   
   # Or try llama3.1 (works well for code tasks)
   ollama pull llama3.1
   ```

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/caspiras/Slice.git
cd Slice

# Install Python package
pip install -e .
```

## Uninstall

```bash
# Uninstall the package
pip uninstall slice
```

**Upgrading from v1.0 (slice-agent)?**
```bash
# Uninstall old version first
pip uninstall slice-agent -y

# Then install new version
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start Slice
slice
```

1. **Select a model** using arrow keys (↑/↓) and press Enter
2. **Start chatting** at the 🍕 prompt
3. **Ask it to do things** - it will request permission before executing
4. **Switch models anytime** by typing `/model`
5. **Exit gracefully** with Ctrl+C (twice)

## Skills - Custom Slash Commands

Slice v1.5.1 introduces **skills** - custom slash commands that provide the AI with predefined instructions for common tasks.

### What are Skills?

Skills are instruction sets stored in markdown files that you can invoke with `/skill-name`. When invoked, Slice feeds the instructions to the AI model, guiding it through specific workflows.

### Using Skills

**Built-in example skills:**
```
🍕 /hello        # Greeting with system information
🍕 /test         # Test the skills system
🍕 /git-status   # Git repository status
```

**Create your own skills:**

1. Create a `slice-skills/` directory in your project
2. Create a folder for your skill (the folder name becomes the command)
3. Add a `skill.md` file inside with this format:

```
slice-skills/
└── deploy/
    └── skill.md
```

```markdown
---
description: Deploy the application
---

# Deployment Instructions

When invoked:
1. Run tests with `pytest`
2. Build with `npm run build`
3. Deploy with `./deploy.sh`
4. Verify deployment
```

4. Invoke with `/deploy` in Slice

## Usage Examples

### Just Chat
```
🍕 what is Python?
```
The AI answers directly from knowledge - no commands, just conversation.

### Ask It to Do Something
```
🍕 create a file called notes.txt
```

You'll see:
```
🔧 Action Requested
To create a new text file

┌─ Command ────────────┐
│ touch notes.txt      │
└──────────────────────┘

Execute this command? (y/N): y
✓ Command completed successfully
```

### Common Use Cases

**Code editing with diffs:**
```
🍕 read main.py and fix the typo where it says "resposne" instead of "response"
```
Shows a syntax-highlighted diff for your approval before applying changes.

**Document operations:**
```
🍕 what's the total in the budget.xlsx file for Q2?
🍕 create a PDF report called summary.pdf with our Q1 findings
🍕 read contract.pdf and extract the key terms into a spreadsheet
```
Read/write ANY document type - PDF, Excel, Word, CSV, Markdown, etc.

**File format conversion:**
```
🍕 convert budget.xlsx to budget.json
🍕 convert report.docx to report.json
🍕 convert contract.pdf to contract.json
🍕 convert data.csv to data.json
```
Seamlessly convert Excel, Word, PDF, and CSV files to JSON format.

**Git workflows:**
```
🍕 check git status and create a commit with my changes
```
Stages files and creates commits (never auto-pushes without explicit request).

**File operations:**
- "Create a folder called src"
- "List all Python files in this directory"
- "Search for TODO comments in my code"

**Code exploration:**
- "Find all functions that use the requests library"
- "Show me files modified in the last 24 hours"
- "What's the overall structure of this project?"

### Switch Models Mid-Session
```
🍕 /model
```
Use arrow keys to pick a new model. Your conversation history is preserved!

## Security & Safety

Slice is designed with **security first**. Multiple layers protect your system:

### 🔒 Directory Sandboxing (Primary Protection)

**By default, all commands are restricted to the directory where you started `slice`.**

**💡 Best Practice:** Always start Slice inside a specific project folder, not in your home directory or system root. This provides natural boundaries for operations:

```bash
# ✅ Good - Start in a specific project
cd ~/projects/my-app
slice

# ❌ Avoid - Starting in home directory or root
cd ~
slice
```

Commands attempting to access files outside trigger a **red warning**:

```
⚠️  SANDBOX ESCAPE DETECTED
This command tries to access paths outside: /your/current/directory
Suspicious paths:
  • /etc/hosts (absolute path)
  • ~/Documents (home directory)
  • ../../../file.txt (parent directory)

⚠️  Are you SURE you want to execute this? (yes/N):
```

**Protected patterns:**
- ✋ Absolute paths: `/tmp/file`, `/etc/hosts`
- ✋ Home directory: `~/Documents/file`
- ✋ Parent traversal: `../../sensitive/file`
- ✋ Directory changes: `cd /tmp`

**Override when needed:**
- Normal commands: Type **y** to approve
- Sandbox escapes: Type **yes** (full word) to explicitly approve
- Slice can't silently access files outside your starting directory

### 🛡️ Additional Safety Layers

1. **Permission prompts for EVERY command**
   - See exactly what will run before it executes
   - Includes the reason/context from the AI
   - Easy to review and deny

2. **Dangerous command detection**
   - Patterns like `rm -rf /`, `mkfs`, `dd if=` trigger warnings
   - Requires explicit "yes" confirmation

3. **30-second execution timeout**
   - Prevents runaway or hanging commands
   - Automatically kills commands that take too long

4. **No automatic execution**
   - The AI can't run anything without your approval
   - Even if the model tries, you see the prompt first

### 🔐 Privacy & Data

- ✅ **100% local**: Everything runs on your machine via Ollama
- ✅ **No cloud API calls**: Your conversations never leave your computer
- ✅ **No data persistence**: Conversation history only exists while running
- ✅ **No telemetry**: No tracking, logging, or data collection

## How It Works (Technical)

Slice is built entirely in **Python** using the Rich library for beautiful terminal UX:

## Model Recommendations

**Different models behave differently.** Choose based on your task:

### Best for Mixed Chat + Actions
- **gemma4** - Excellent at knowing when to chat vs. execute commands
- **mistral** - Fast, reliable, good tool calling judgment
- **qwen2** - Great multilingual support with smart tool use

```bash
ollama pull gemma4
```

### Best for Code Tasks
- **llama3.1, llama3.2, llama3.3** - Trained heavily for tool use
- May try to execute commands for general knowledge questions
- Works perfectly for file operations and coding workflows

```bash
ollama pull llama3.1
```

**💡 Tip:** Models marked with `[tools ✓]` in the selector support function calling.

## Troubleshooting

### "No local Ollama models found"
- Make sure Ollama is running: `ollama list` should show your models
- Download a model: `ollama pull gemma4`
- Verify Ollama service is active

### Command stuck on "baking..."
- This usually means a permission prompt is waiting
- The latest version fixes display issues - update if needed
- Try pressing Ctrl+C to cancel and restart

### Model tries to run commands for chat questions
- This is model-specific behavior (common with llama3.1/3.2/3.3)
- These models are trained heavily for tool use
- Switch to gemma4, mistral, or qwen2 for better chat/action balance
- Use `/model` command to switch without restarting

### "Command timed out after 30 seconds"
- The command took too long and was automatically killed for safety
- Try breaking the task into smaller commands
- Some operations (large builds, downloads) may need to be run manually

### Exit not working
- Press Ctrl+C **twice** (first shows warning, second exits)
- If stuck in a prompt, Ctrl+C cancels it first, then exit normally
- Make sure you're pressing Ctrl+C, not Ctrl+D

### Permission prompt not visible
- Update to the latest version - older versions had display issues
- The prompt should appear after the "baking..." spinner stops
